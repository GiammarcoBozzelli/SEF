Data information:

To find the list of firms that you will study, download the Data_Excel folder and either in the ESG_scores folder if your group studies ESG scores and in the Carbon_Emissions folder if your group studies CO2 emissions. Then you can restrict to the list of firms based on the country of interest of your group (using the ISIN you can identify the firmâ€™s country) or sector (information related to the sector of each firm is available in the Static_Score or Static_Carbon excel files)
